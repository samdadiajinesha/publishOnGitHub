I have made the background blue, as the design is for Blue Metro Line. Keeping in mind the visibility of design on a fast moving vehicle, text is minimal and illustrations are scaled up forming a continuous curve of hands reaching to help. While the metro is moving it will create a pleasing visual/ animation effect of the curve.  </div> <div class="helping-each-other-container1"> <p class="decal-design-should"> Helping each other can make the world a better place. Low poly style of illustration is used where each triangle represents each person.
